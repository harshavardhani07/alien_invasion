# alien_invasion
* game developed using several modules in python mainly PYGAME
* the scoreboard changes according whenever the bullet group collides the alien group
* even it is ensured that user will have limited chances (number of ships) in a particular game
* whenever user destroys all aliens in a particular level the game gives the user new fleet with increased toghness
* play button,display of level/high_score/current_score/no_of_ships_left are integrated
* we can have little more fun by changing the bullet sizes and the game rules as required
